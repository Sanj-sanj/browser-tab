Added way to make new folder on desktop, state tracks directorys to be updated. Theres a bit of complex code involved to pass all the relavent information from state, to desktop, to the icon to context menu, which gets updated from the icons onContextMenu handler. Thats basically it, its really complex so I will write more about this in the morning to better understand wtf I just created.
