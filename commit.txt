appWindow accepts clearDesktopContext from desktop; passed it on to all the apps to clear context onClick. Added type property to apps inside UserContext. mkdir sets type to folder, used to conditionally call doubleClickHandlers. mkdir also creates an item with the folder's name as the prop w/ value of an array. Can use for nested folder structure. Desktop checks for a title on the icon to create one, otherwise it's a dir, the desktop section is now a grid, with responsive styles. NavAppWindow with style updates. NewFolderApp now passes OpenFiles as the doubleClick handler param for mkdir. FileSystemApp id renamed to fsId, theres a getNestedDirs checks the currentDir for a '.' if found, means its nested, it split the value and then loops over the length of the result, while checking within the state.dirs[split[0]] position, with the variable named start, if found, the start point for the next loop is the found directory, will keep going until done then returns the current start position of the dirs, as well as an array with all the 'dirs' which get looped to make buttons for the nav. The start array gets looped and icons get created from the items granted item.title is a thing, otherwise that item is a directory.
